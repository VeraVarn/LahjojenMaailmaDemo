## Development Process

During this project, we followed an **Agile/Scrum workflow** mixed with some elements from the design process. The project was divided into **two 2-week sprints**. In addition to development, we conducted extensive research and gained valuable insights.

### Project Phases

1. **Ideation**

- Developed a business case and project plan
- Defined the brief, objectives, key requirements (MVP), and decicded on budget
- Created the content structure, sitemap, and core website functionalities
We ensured everything aligns with our learning goals set in the beginning of the project.

2. **Research**

- Conducted topic, technology, and platform research
- Made product benchmarking and competitor analysis
- Concluded UI benchmarking and data analysis

3. **Design**

- Created UI designs, sketches, wireframes, and prototypes
- Developed visual branding, including a brand guide
- Designed assets and placeholders for use in the prototype

4. **Development**

- Mainly focused on front-end development and the creation of a demo prototype
- Worked on custom theme development, though this was canceled due to time restrictions

### Work Methods and Collaboration

- **Daily Standups**: Regular daily check-ins to ensure progress and address issues
- **Sprint Closings & Retrospectives**: Reflections to evaluate progress and identify areas for improvement
- **Stakeholder Meeting**s: Collaborated with stakeholder to align goals and gather feedback
- **Workshop**: Hosted a placeholder product ideation workshop for the demo site

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For frontend and functionalities
- **Netlify**: Hosting the site
- **Google's tools**: Meetings, notes and documentation
- **Trello**: Project management
- **Figma**: UI design
- **Photoshop/Illustator/Canva**: Assets, product pictures, mockups and project pitch slides
- **ChatGPT**: Proofreading and referencing, assistance in ideation and research, coding (JavaScript) and fixing bugs

## Reflection

This project was a huge learning experience for me, which made my technical skills grow, do problem solving in a creative way, and improve my teamworking skills with our awesome team. Below, I reflect on the lessons I learned, the obstacles I faced, and the improvements that could be made in future

### Lessons Learned:

My personal goals in the beginning of the project were to build a strong foundation in IT fundamentals, gain deeper knowledge of key topics in the field, and improve my JavaScript skills. I also wanted to experience working on an e-commerce project and refresh my WordPress development skills. I hoped we would achieve a working product that could serve as a usable platform.

Looking back, I achieved these goals and exceeded them. My biggest area of improvement was in **project management**, and also in **web development** and **digital product design**. I used my existing skills in **HTML and CSS**, while getting into more advanced **JavaScript concepts** with the help of AI.

I got hands-on experience with **WordPress development** and even tried a bit of **WooCommerce development**. Additionally, I did research on many platforms and tools, learning how they work and how to retrieve data from other sites. This project provided a boost to my technical skills and made me understand better the field as a whole.

### Challenges Overcome:

After the project ended, I fixed a major bug related to the sliders on the site, which had been breaking the overall functionality. The issue stemmed from all sliders being treated as a single instance. While this bug did not impact our demonstration, I decided to address it on my own out of curiosity to solve this problem.

My initial thought refactoring the code into an object that could be called to create independent instances for each slider. To achieve this, I turned to rely on the AIs help.

The final approach was to refactor the code into a class. This allowed for the creation of independent instances for each slider, with encapsulated logic to ensure each slider operated separately. After this fix, the initial issue was resolved. However, after fixing the bug, some older problem of sliders not showing all the product cards properly resurfaced. I left it there given the project's demo nature. Showcasing the features were passable to see the whole picture, so the solution was sufficient enough answer for my question to how to fix this issue.

### Future Improvements:

Other considerations we would have liked to address:
- **Proper testing** based on Aida's research and best practices
- **Enhancing accessibility** to meet at least WCAG AA standards (as per EEA guidelines)
- **Improving SEO optimization** to increase visibility and search engine ranking
